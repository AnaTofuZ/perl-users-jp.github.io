cpan-outdated - detect outdated CPAN modules in your environment
meta-date: 2010-12-19

Are you using fresh modules? Okay, the old modules have a bug and less feature.
Use the latest modules!

B<cpan-outdated> script prints the list of outdated CPAN modules in your machine.
It's same feature of 'CPAN::Shell->r', but cpan-outdated is much faster and uses less memory.

This script can be integrated with cpanm command.

Just run:

    % cpan-outdated | cpanm

Enjoy!
