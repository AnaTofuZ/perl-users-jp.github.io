Furl - Lightning fast HTTP client library

First, LWP is very good HTTP client library. It's de-facto standard in Perl5 world.
But, it's bit slow if you are using for RPC over HTTP.

For example, <a href="http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/">KyotoTycoon</a> supports RPC over HTTP.

Synopsis code is here.
>|perl|
    use Furl;

    my $furl = Furl::HTTP->new(
        agent   => 'MyGreatUA/2.0',
        timeout => 10,
    );

    my ($minor_version, $code, $msg, $headers, $body) = $furl->request(
        method => 'GET',
        host   => 'example.com',
        port   => 80,
        path   => '/'
    );
    # or

    # Accept-Encoding is supported but optional
    $furl = Furl->new(
        headers => [ 'Accept-Encoding' => 'gzip' ],
    );
    my $body = $furl->get('http://example.com/some/compressed');
||<

Furl does not requires XS(XS part exists, but optional.).

<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-Curl/">WWW::Curl</a> is very fast too.
But, it depends on libcurl. It's bit hard to install.
